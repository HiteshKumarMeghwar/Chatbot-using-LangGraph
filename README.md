# Chatbot-using-LangGraph
This is the chatbot using langgraph with full of functionality ( chatting, RAG, Tools, UI, Langsmith ) and in RAG ( memory, persistance, HITL, Retry ) and many things are there.

Chatbot-using-LangGraph is an end-to-end, enterprise-grade conversational AI framework designed to operationalize modern LLM capabilities with a robust architecture. This project brings together a full suite of high-value functionalities — from dynamic conversations and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to tools execution, observability, and a polished UI layer — all orchestrated through LangGraph for predictable, stateful, and fault-tolerant behavior.

This implementation isn’t just a demo; it’s a scalable template engineered for real-world deployments.

# 🚀 Key Capabilities
## 1. Intelligent Chat Engine

A fully interactive conversational agent capable of:

Context-aware dialogue

Memory-driven personalization

Deterministic workflows powered by LangGraph nodes

Safe fallback logic and structured responses

## 2. Advanced RAG Pipeline

A production-hardened Retrieval-Augmented Generation system featuring:

Persistent vector storage

User-level memory injection

Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) interventions

Automatic retries & recovery

Noise-resistant JSON parsing

Query rewriting & multi-query retrievers

Built for clarity, traceability, and high-relevance answer generation.

## 3. Tools & Function Calling

The chatbot integrates with external tools for enhanced reasoning:

Function execution

Data lookups

Knowledge queries

Extensible tool registry

This enables the agent to behave like a true digital operator, not just a text generator.

## 4. Custom UI Layer

A sleek, user-friendly interface for:

Real-time messaging

Streaming responses

Message history

Developer-friendly debugging hooks

Perfect for showcasing the complete system in demos or product environments.

## 5. LangSmith Integration

Deep observability and monitoring across:

Traces

Runs

Model behavior

Evaluation metrics

Ideal for iterative improvement and enterprise compliance.

## 6. Modular & Extensible Architecture

The project is organized for long-term maintainability:

Independent modules for chat, tools, RAG, and evaluation

Clean state definitions

Workflow-level orchestration

Easy integration of new models, tools, and nodes

A future-proof baseline you can build on.

# 🎯 Why This Repository Matters

This project showcases how modern AI applications should be architected — with structure, observability, resilience, and modularity at the center. It embodies a forward-thinking but deeply practical approach: blending LangGraph’s deterministic control with LLM flexibility, while weaving in enterprise-ready components like LangSmith and persistent RAG.
